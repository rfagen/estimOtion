0. Make sure you have ruby installed (beyond the scope of this doc)
1. Download the zip file from github
2. Unzip in a directory
3. Edit estimotion_config.yml.example, update the parameters and save as estimotion_config.yml in the same directory
4. Run 'bundle' -- this will install all of the requirements
5. Run 'start.sh' 
  * this will output the logs into nohup.out
  * if you want to watch along then before running start.sh, execute 'tail -f nohup.out &'
6. In your browser, load "localhost:4567" and you should see the 'start'/'join' page.
